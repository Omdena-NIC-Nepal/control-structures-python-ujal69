    "Welcome to the Python Control Structures Assignment! In this assignment, you will work through a series of exercises to test your understanding of Python control structures like `while`, `for`, and `if` statements, including the use of `break` and `continue` statements. Your task is to implement the provided starter code and ensure your solutions meet the requirements.\n",
